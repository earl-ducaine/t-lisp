Things need for full system:

Type analysis (at least enough to do proclaim or declare e.g. fx=)

Representations -- needs types

Define-foreign -- needs representations to do right, could do version with
                  pointer->integer etc. now.

Lap, icall, etc. stuff now in kernel (where does stuff go?) things can be
global to module (in unit), process (off task register), or system
(nil register).

More primops, e.g. flonum stuff.  Needs type and representations.

structures? operations? set?
