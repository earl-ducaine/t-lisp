T on Titan

Repertoire of type hacks.  Not mutually exclusive.

    - TLB hack

    - BIBOP
	- Pair space vs. extend space

    - Put prefix word (i.e. templates) on cons cells

    - Doublecell alignment

    - Two fixnum types, positive and negative

Criteria:

    Runtime costs of PAIR?, EXTEND?, TEMPLATE?, PROCEDURE?
	(want to increase the number of tag bits, maybe)
    Runtime cost of fixnum arithmetic
	(want to avoid putting tag bits at high end of word)
	(want to use tag 0)

    Memory use
	(want to distinguish pairs from extends by tag bit)
    Simplicity

Options:

    B - BIBOP     0 or 1 tag bits (effective)
    H - high end  0, 1, or 2 tag bits (masked out either by code or by TLB)
    L - low end   0 or 1 bit (by doublecell aligning or not)

	B H L
	0 0 1
	0 1 0
	0 1 1
	0 2 0
	1 0 1
	1 1 0

Calling sequence and the clean/dirty problem.
