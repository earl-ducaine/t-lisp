Object Dumper
=============
 
The object dumper can be used to dump the T objects into a file in a
compact encoding binary format, and read in later on in an efficient way.

The data structures the dumper currently supports are integers, 
characters, symbols, strings, lists, vectors, byte vectors, floating 
point numbers, big numbers, fix numbers, and the data structures
composed by them.  

The encoding and decoding will not duplicate any non-immedicate data          s
structures and allow circular data structures.

The following is an example of how to use the dumper:

    Before doing anything we need to load in the dumper file by

    (load "loaddump.bin")

Dumping:

    (lset s(open-dump "foo.tmp"))

    (dump s obj1)
    (dump s obj2)

       ...
    (dump s objN)

    (close-dump s)


Reading from the dumped file:

    (lset d (open-dumped "foo.tmp"))

    (lset obj1 (get-dump d))
    (lset obj2 (get-dump d))

       ...
    (lset objN (get-dump d))

    (close-dumped d)

If you call "(get-dump d)" more than N times, it will return end-of-file.
