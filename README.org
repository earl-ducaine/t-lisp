** Abstract of project

   From: http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html

   Around 1981-1982, the Yale CS dept., which had a strong AI group
   led by Roger Schank, hired undergraduate Jonathan Rees to implement
   a new Lisp for their research programming. Jonathan, I and Dan Weld
   (now a prof. at U Washington) were the three people at Yale that
   had discovered the early Sussman/Steele "lambda" papers, including
   Guy's seminal master's thesis on Rabbit, the first Scheme
   compiler. Dan was a college senior; Jonathan & I were juniors. Alan
   Perlis, the soul of the department, had just discovered functional
   programming, and was running a graduate seminar covering early FP
   languages such as Hope & Miranda & Scheme. The three of us managed
   to sleaze our way into this grad class, where we met each other.
